## How to Use üîß
Toggle Scout `on` to search the DOM for all `data-test` attributes and highlight them. You can then hover on these elements to showcase the test ID values.

Toggle Scout `off` to remove the highlight feature.

## Notes ‚ú®
- Scout only runs on elements that are present on the DOM
- You'll need to trigger the highlighter anytime you navigate to a new page or the contents re-render with new elements
- Scout will keep track of the state you left it in, even when the popup closes

Check out the [demo page](https://scout.codes/demo) for an example!

### Known Issues in Firefox

The extension works fine. However, the pop-up dialog that appears when you activate the extension has the following issues:

- Switching Scout "on" will successfully activate Scout but the switch's label will read 'Off'.
- It does not currently show the number of `data-test` elements that Scout finds on the current page.
