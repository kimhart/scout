## How to Use ðŸ”§
Toggle Scout `on` to search the DOM for all `data-test` attributes and highlight them. You can then hover on these elements to showcase the test ID values.

Toggle Scout `off` to remove the highlight feature.

## Notes âœ¨
- Scout only runs on elements that are present on the DOM
- You'll need to trigger the highlighter anytime you navigate to a new page or the contents re-render with new elements
- Scout will keep track of the state you left it in, even when the popup closes
